# Chinese Linguistic Corpus EEG Dataset Development and Advanced Semantic Decoding

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive paradigm for the establishment of an EEG dataset based on Chinese linguistic corpus. It seeks to facilitate the advancement of technologies related to EEG-based semantic decoding and brain-computer interfaces. The project is currently divided into the following modules: Chinese corpus segmentation, experimental design and stimulus presentation, data preprocessing, and data masking. For detailed information on each module, please refer to the README document in the respective folders or view the relevant code.

For now, we have already recorded EEG data of 10 subjects, each data contains a nearly 12 hours long time.
