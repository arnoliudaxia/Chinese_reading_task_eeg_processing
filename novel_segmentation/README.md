# Chinese language corpus segmentation 

## Introduction

This README file aims to illustrate how to segment Chinese novel using our code.

## Code Explanation

You should run `cut_Chinese_novel.py` to process your `.txt` formated Chinese novel for sentence segmentation, obtaining the corresponding formatted `.xlsx` files. 

`cut_Chinese_novel.py` is used to process the novel into a suitable format for presentation in the Psychopy program. The novel content will be segmented into a series of units, each containing no more than 10 Chinese characters, and adjacent three units will be combined to form the content of each frame during the screen presentation. The same combination of adjacent units will be repeated multiple times to facilitate the subsequent highlighting display of each individual character. Additionally, you can specify to divide the novel from certain chapters into several parts and output them as separate files.

The format of the novel content should meet the following requirements:

1. **The beginning of the file should contain the preface section with a sign Ch0**. The preface will be used as a simulation before reading the formal chapters.
2. Each subsequent chapter should start with a sign **Ch + \<chapter number>**.

Below is an example:

```
Chinese_novel.txt
Ch0
This is the preface of the novel
Ch1
Chapter 1 of the novel
Ch2
Chapter 2 of the novel
...
...
...
```

In real experiments, considering issues like eye tracker battery life, we must perform battery replacement during the experiment. Due to technical constraints, we have to temporarily stop the experiment program during battery replacement. Therefore, we may divide a complete novel into multiple parts and present each part during each complete program run. For example, we may divide a novel with 30 chapters to 4 parts, and we will run the program several times to finish the entire novel content. 

In this script, you can specify the chapters you want to divide the novel by changing parameter `divide_num` , and the program will divide the chapters and output the  files containing these different parts.

The output files are as follows:

`segmented_Chinese_novel_preface.xlsx`: The processed preface of the novel.

`segmented_Chinese_novel_main_1.xlsx`: The processed main body of the novel content.

`segmented_Chinese_novel_main_2.xlsx`: The processed main body of the novel content.

... 

(number of files depends on your setting)



We provide a `.txt` file of the novel *The Little Prince* and the 5 processed `.xlsx` files as an example. 

#### Parameters

| Parameter          | type | usage                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| divide_nums        | str  | Breakpoints which you want to divide your novel (comma-separated). e.g. If you want to break the novel from chapter 8, 16, 24, you should pass the argument as --divide_nums=8,16,24 |
| Chinese_novel_path | str  | Path to your `.txt` Chinese novel content                    |
